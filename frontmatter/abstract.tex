\noindent\hspace{2em}This diploma thesis explores the development and implementation of information security standards and policies within organizations, focusing on integrating international best practices with Kazakhstan’s regulatory context. The study compares major cybersecurity frameworks – ISO/IEC 27001:2022, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, and the EU GDPR – and analyzes their relevance and adaptability to Kazakhstan, considering national laws like the Law on Informatization and Law on Personal Data. It also details the methodology and results of developing a web-based and mobile solution to help a fictional company (“QazFinTech Bank”) adopt and operationalize security standards and policies. The Literature Review provides a comparative analysis of the frameworks and local regulations. The Methodology outlines how theoretical research and practical development were conducted. The Practical Implementation chapter describes the design of a website (HTML/CSS/JS) and a mobile application (React Native with a Node.js backend) that assist organizations in policy adoption and compliance. In Development of Security Standards and Policies, original policy documents and control standards tailored to Kazakhstani organizations are created, bridging ISO/NIST controls with local legal requirements; this includes tables mapping controls to policies, and defining user roles with access levels. The Results and Discussion demonstrate how these standards and tools would function in the QazFinTech Bank scenario, analyzing benefits, limitations, and regulatory impacts. Finally, the Conclusion summarizes findings, highlights the potential for broader adoption at a national level, and suggests avenues for future research. This work aims to contribute both a practical toolkit and strategic guidance for organizations in Kazakhstan seeking to enhance their cybersecurity posture in line with international standards and local laws.
